PROBLEM 3: STRING REVERSAL : 10.0 POINTS
========================================

PART B: Recursion
-----------------

The file ps5_recursion.py contains the skeleton code for the next three problems.

Fill in the function reverseString(aStr) according to the specification. The only string operations you are allowed to use are indexing, slicing, and concatenation.

This function has to be recursive! You may not use loops (for or while) to solve this problem.
